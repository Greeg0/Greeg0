Hello. I am an awful developer. People tell me I should learn the language before I program anything with it! I am way too lazy to learn the basics of the language before I program, I just want to make a program and I tack together stuff I find online and struggle stuff out of my own knowledge to create programs.
So far, BounceWii turned out to be my most sucessful program so far. 

I like trees.
